# Rapid and Effective Synthesis of α‑Acyloxy-α-alkynyltrimethylsilanes

α-Alkynyl-α′-trimethylsilylhydrazones are readily oxidized into diazo compounds under simple experimental conditions. These stable diazo species can in turn react with a range of carboxylic acids via a protonation−nucleophilic substitution sequence, leading to valuable α-acyloxy-α-alkynyltrimethylsilanes. This procedure avoids the delicate preparation and manipulation of α-hydroxypropargyltrimethylsilanes.

## Expedient Synthesis of 1,4-Benzodiazepines via a Tandem Condensation/[1,5]-Hydride Transfer/Cyclization Process

An expedient approach to 1,4-benzodiazepines via a tandem condensation/[1,5]-hydride shift/cyclization process has been developed. This transformation started from readily available o-amino benzaldehyde and aminomalonate and was promoted by low-cost FeCl3 with high step and atom economy.

### Zinc Chloride Catalyzed Stereoselective Construction of Spiropyrazolone Tetrahydroquinolines via Tandem [1,5]-Hydride Shift/Cyclization Sequence

```js
A zninc chloride catalyzed tandem 1,5-hydride shift/cyclization
process to form spiropyrazolone terahydroquinoline derivatives is
developed. A series of new spiropyrazolone derivatives were
obtained in good to high yields with good to excellent
diastereoselectivities (up to 95% yield, >95:5 dr). Additionally, the
spiropyrazolone derivatives could be converted into the
corresponding novel spriopyrazolines.

#### A ZnCl2-Catalyzed Knoevenagel Condensation/1,5-Hydride Shift/Cyclization Sequence: Synthesis of Novel Spiroisoxazol-5-one Tetrahydroquinolines

*   A concise synthesis of novel spiroisoxazol-5-one tetrahydroquinoline derivatives has been developed by an efficient
ZnCl2-catalyzed stereoselective Knoevenagel Condensation/1,5-
hydride shift/cyclization sequence. The reactions are broad in
scope and the products could be obtained in good to high
yields (up to 97% yield) with good to excellent diastereoselectivities (up to >95:5 dr). In addition, these products
may be converted into novel 5-hydroxy-spiroisoxazolines and
spiropyrazolones.
